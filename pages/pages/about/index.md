I love to learn bleeding edge new technology and enjoy to share with fellow developers that need a guidance and upgrade their skill so they can have a better career or do their own business.

I'm the Curriculum Director of Hacktiv8, a company I started with [Ronald Ishak](https://ronishak.com), in an attempt to solve the developer hiring crunch that has hindered the growth of many aspiring tech startups in Indonesia. Through a 12-week immersive curriculum offered through Hacktiv8, aims to raise the quality of web developers and connect them with the best tech companies in the country.

Knowledge sharing is deeply engrained with my passion and is evident through involvement in many initiatives such as becoming a lecturer at [Universitas Budi Luhur](https://budiluhur.ac.id); becoming an organizer for [JakartaJS](https://www.meetup.com/jakartajs/), [Meteor Jakarta](https://www.meetup.com/Meteor-Jakarta/) and [React Indonesia](https://www.meetup.com/reactindonesia/); a speaker at [Singapore Elixir Meetup](https://www.meetup.com/Singapore-Elixir-Meetup/events/229685862/), [GeekCamp](http://www.geekcamp.id/), [Lambda Jakarta](https://www.meetup.com/Lambda-Jakarta/events/230464443/) and much more to come. In my free time, I'm hosts a podcast called [AppsCoast](http://appscoast.id), a podcast of interviews aspiring startup founders, and technologists and uncover their mission. 

Technology is the core to solving the next generation of problems and by teaching people the foundations of programming, I believe we can solve Indonesiaâ€™s future problems together.
